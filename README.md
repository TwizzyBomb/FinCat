# FinCat
This project is a transaction sorter and budget categorizing and planning tool written by Yahia Adrian Brocke

# Todo:

// looping through the known categories,
// testing each entry in the known categories to the new entry in the csv file
// if all fields match we know its a perfect match, was entered and we skip it
// else if just the strings match we set foundMatch == true and ask user to add the string to the category
// else gives the user the option to add it to a category of his choosing,
// loop through the available categories and if not added to one of these
// give the user the chance to create a new category

// write to categories.xml file
// print out a report
